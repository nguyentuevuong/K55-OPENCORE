# K55-OPENCORE
OpenCore for Asus K55 (VD) laptop (macOS 10.15.7)
After many failed tests with different version OCs. I decided to keep the OC at version 064 for the most stability.

Currently all most of the functions are fully functional, however, there are still a few problems.

**Working:**
- iGPU
- HDMI
- CPU steps
- sleep
- audio
- multitouch
- FN keys
- USB
- camera
- wifi
...

**Not working:**
- Card reader
- Bluetooth
...
 
**Application issue:**
- AppStore sometime (may be) crash.
- iMessage: not check.
